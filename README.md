# The-Colorful-Cars
In a parking lot, there are 20 cars parked in a straight line. Each car is painted with one of four different colors: red, blue, green, or yellow. You know the following information about the cars:

There are five red cars.
There are four blue cars.
The number of green cars is twice the number of yellow cars.
How many green cars are there, and in what order are the cars parked?

Solution:
Let's assume the number of green cars is x and the number of yellow cars is y.

From the given information, there are five red cars, four blue cars, x green cars, and y yellow cars. So, the total number of cars is 5 (red) + 4 (blue) + x (green) + y (yellow) = 9 + x + y.

It's given that the total number of cars is 20, so we have the equation 9 + x + y = 20.

Also, it's mentioned that the number of green cars is twice the number of yellow cars, so we have the equation x = 2y.

Now, we have two equations:

x = 2y
9 + x + y = 20
Solving the equations, we get:

y = 3
x = 2y = 2 * 3 = 6
So, there are 6 green cars and 3 yellow cars. The order of the cars can be arranged as follows:
Red - Red - Red - Red - Red - Blue - Blue - Blue - Blue - Green - Green - Green - Green - Green - Green - Yellow - Yellow - Yellow
